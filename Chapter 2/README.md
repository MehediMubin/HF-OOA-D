### Chapter 2: Give Them What They Want: gathering requirements

This chapter was all about why requirements are important, how to gather requirements, and how to use "use cases" to create better requirements.

Sometimes (most of the time) users will not know what they really want. You, as an engineer, should figure that out. You should also figure out alternate paths (extensions) along with the main path (happy path). Because, in the real world, things go south.

These were the main themes of Chapter 2.
