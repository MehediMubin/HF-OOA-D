### Chapter 1: Getting Started with Object-Oriented Analysis and Design

In this chapter, we will explore the basics of object-oriented analysis and design. We have created a simple inventory management system for guitars. The main classes and their responsibilities are:

-  `Builder`: Enum representing different guitar builders.
-  `Type`: Enum representing different guitar types.
-  `Wood`: Enum representing different types of wood used in guitars.
-  `GuitarSpec`: Class representing the specifications of a guitar.
-  `Guitar`: Class representing a guitar.
-  `Inventory`: Class representing the inventory of guitars.
